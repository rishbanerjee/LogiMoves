This website platform is there to help food exporters and warehouses to reduce the delay and food wastage during transportation, due to time delays at checkpoints during the inter-state crossing and more due to inadequate facilities and conditions at warehouses and godowns. This platform acts as an intermediate between the exporter and warehouse owner so that they can have all the documents required and the exporter can get warehouses suitable for them.
